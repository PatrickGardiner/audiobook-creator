# Audiobook Creator

## Overview

Audiobook Creator is an open-source project designed to convert books in various text formats (e.g., EPUB, PDF, etc.) into fully voiced audiobooks with intelligent character voice attribution. It leverages modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to create an engaging and dynamic audiobook experience. The project features professional-grade TTS engines including [Kokoro TTS](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) and [Orpheus-TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS) with advanced async parallel processing, offering exceptional audio quality with memory-efficient processing. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0), ensuring that it remains free and open for everyone to use, modify, and distribute.

<details>
<summary>The project consists of four main components:</summary>

1. **Text Cleaning and Formatting (`book_to_txt.py`)**:
   - Extracts and cleans text from a book file (e.g., `book.epub`).
   - Normalizes special characters, fixes line breaks, and corrects formatting issues such as unterminated quotes or incomplete lines.
   - Extracts the main content between specified markers (e.g., "PROLOGUE" and "ABOUT THE AUTHOR").
   - Outputs the cleaned text to `converted_book.txt`.

2. **Character Identification and Metadata Generation (`identify_characters_and_output_book_to_jsonl.py`)**:
   - Identifies characters in the text using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the GLiNER model.
   - Assigns gender and age scores to characters using an LLM via an OpenAI-compatible API.
   - Outputs two files:
     - `speaker_attributed_book.jsonl`: Each line of text annotated with the identified speaker.
     - `character_gender_map.json`: Metadata about characters, including name, age, gender, and gender score.

3. **Emotion Tags Enhancement (`add_emotion_tags.py`)**:
   - Adds emotion tags (e.g., `<laugh>`, `<sigh>`, `<gasp>` etc.) to enhance narration expressiveness.
   - Processes `converted_book.txt` and outputs enhanced text to `tag_added_lines_chunks.txt`.
   - Voice-agnostic: works with both single-voice and multi-voice audiobook generation.
   - Requires Orpheus TTS engine for emotion tag support.

4. **Audiobook Generation (`generate_audiobook.py`)**:
   - Converts the cleaned text (`converted_book.txt`) or speaker-attributed text (`speaker_attributed_book.jsonl`) into an audiobook using advanced TTS models.
   - **Multi-Engine Support**: Compatible with both Kokoro TTS ([Hexgrad/Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M)) and Orpheus TTS ([Orpheus-TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS)) with engine-specific voice mapping.
   - Offers two narration modes:
     - **Single-Voice**: Uses a single voice for narration and another voice for dialogues for the entire book.
     - **Multi-Voice**: Assigns different voices to characters based on their gender scores.
   - Saves the audiobook in the selected output format to `generated_audiobooks/audiobook.{output_format}`.

## Get Started

### Initial Setup
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Make sure host networking is enabled in your docker setup : https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/. Host networking is currently supported in Linux and in docker desktop. To use with [docker desktop, follow these steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/#docker-desktop)
- Set up your LLM and expose an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g., using LM Studio with `qwen3-14b`).
- **Set up TTS Engine**: Choose between Kokoro or Orpheus TTS models:

   ### Option 1: Kokoro TTS (Recommended for most users)
   Set up the Kokoro TTS model via [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI). To get started, run the docker image using the following command:

   For CUDA based GPU inference (Apple Silicon GPUs currently not supported, use CPU based inference instead). Choose the value of TTS_MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE based on [this guide](https://github.com/prakharsr/audiobook-creator/?tab=readme-ov-file#parallel-batch-inferencing-of-audio-for-faster-audio-generation)

   ```bash
  docker run \
    --name kokoro_service \
    --restart always \
    --network host \
    --gpus all \
    ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-gpu:v0.2.1 \
    uvicorn api.src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8880 --log-level debug \
    --workers {TTS_MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE}
   ```

   For CPU based inference. In this case you can keep number of workers as 1 as only mostly GPU based inferencing benefits from parallel workers and batch requests.

   ```bash
  docker run \
    --name kokoro_service \
    --restart always \
    --network host \
    ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:v0.2.1 \
    uvicorn api.src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8880 --log-level debug \
    --workers 1
   ```

   ### Option 2: Orpheus TTS (High-Quality and More Expressive Audio and Support for Emotion Tags)
   Experience premium audio quality with the Orpheus TTS FastAPI server featuring vLLM backend and bfloat16/ float16/ float32 precision. Set up Orpheus TTS using my dedicated [Orpheus TTS FastAPI](https://github.com/prakharsr/Orpheus-TTS-FastAPI) repository.

   **IMPORTANT:** Choose only highest possible precision (bf16/ fp16/ fp32) and this vLLM based FastAPI server as I noticed that using quantized versions of Orpheus or even using float16 GGUF with llama.cpp gave me audio quality issues and artifacts (repeated lines in audio/ extended audio with no spoken text but weird noises/ audio hallucinations/ infinite audio looping/ some other issues). The linked repository for FastAPI server also has some additional improvements to fix such issues by detecting decoding errors, infinite audio loops and having a retry mechanism which tries to fix these audio issues automatically. 

   **Setup Instructions:**
   Please follow the complete setup instructions from the [Orpheus TTS FastAPI repository](https://github.com/prakharsr/Orpheus-TTS-FastAPI) as it contains all the necessary configuration details, installation steps, and optimization guides.

- Create a .env file from .env_sample and configure it with the correct values. Make sure you follow the instructions mentioned at the top of .env_sample to avoid errors.
   ```bash
   cp .env_sample .env
   ```
- After this, choose between the below options for the next step to run the audiobook creator app:

      For CUDA based GPU inference (Apple Silicon GPUs currently not supported, use CPU based inference instead)

      ```bash
      docker run \
         --name audiobook_creator \
         --restart always \
         --network host \
         --gpus all \
         --env-file .env \
         -v model_cache:/app/model_cache \
         ghcr.io/prakharsr/audiobook_creator_gpu:v1.4
      ```

      For CPU based inference

### Parallel batch inferencing of audio for faster audio generation

- Choose the value of **TTS_MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE** based on your available VRAM to accelerate the generation of audio by using parallel batch inferencing. This variable defines the max number of parallel requests that can be made to TTS FastAPI for faster audio generation.

#### For Kokoro TTS:
- This variable is used while setting up the number of workers in Kokoro docker container and as an env variable, so make sure you set the same values for both of them. 
- You can consider setting this value to your available (VRAM/ 2) and play around with the value to see if it works best. 
- If you are unsure then a good starting point for this value can be a value of 2. 
- If you face issues of running out of memory then consider lowering the value for both workers and for the env variable.

#### For Orpheus TTS:
- The Orpheus TTS FastAPI server with vLLM backend provides native async parallel processing capabilities with significant performance improvements (up to 4x faster for long texts).
- The `TTS_MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE` parameter controls the number of concurrent requests to the Orpheus server, taking advantage of its advanced async processing pipeline.
- **Recommended values**: Start with 4-8 for most setups. Higher values (8-16) can be used with sufficient VRAM and GPU processing power.
- The server automatically handles intelligent text chunking and parallel token generation, providing optimal performance without manual tuning.
- For specific configuration and optimization guidance, refer to the [Orpheus TTS FastAPI repository](https://github.com/prakharsr/Orpheus-TTS-FastAPI) documentation.
